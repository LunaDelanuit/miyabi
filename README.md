# Vale

Vale is a 64-bit operating system available for the x86_64 architecture.  
At its current state, Vale is extremely limited, but has been tested on real hardware.

I plan to make Vale Unix-like and potentially POSIX-complaint.

I *do not* plan to ever make Vale UNIX certified, nor do I plan to make Vale a part of the GNU Project for now.  
Vale is an independant operating system with no current intentions of replacing existing systems such as GNU/Linux.

Now I am following my own custom model, a hybrid of a Microkernel and a Monolithic-kernel. It reduces the overhead and reduency of microkernel designs with the IPC,
but also less complex and tied together than a Monolithic-kernel, allowing theoretically better stability.

## Build

Required build tools:

* Any GNU/Linux system.
* Python 3.x `python3`
* GNU C Compiler `gcc`
* Netwide Assembler `nasm`
* GNU Linker `ld`
* Xorriso `xorriso`
* Limine 10.x-12.x `limine`

Optionally:

* QEMU `qemu-system-x86_64` if you want to emulate Vale.

In the project root, simply run `make`; an ISO file will be generated in ./build.
Alternatively, type `make run` to emulate Vale using QEMU.

## Features

Currently, Vale has:

* BIOS & UEFI Support
* GDT & IDT
* PIC Interrupts
* Stable Heap allocator
* Device Framebuffer using VFS
* Initramfs

Limited to:

* x86_64 Only
* No APIC
* Barely usuable (for now)

Does not have:

* Multi-architectural support
* Filesystems (tho we have an initramfs)
* Process Switching
* System Calls
* Everything else

### Limine Protocol

Limine Protocol is used for the internal systems and ease of use when developing Vale.
It provides an easy to use starting point with BIOS and UEFI support, basic implementations set up.
